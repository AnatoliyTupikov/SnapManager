@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
@* The layout specified can use a full path (for example, /Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml or /Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml) or a partial name (example: _Layout). 
When a partial name is provided, the Razor view engine searches for the layout file using its standard discovery process. 
The folder where the handler method (or controller) exists is searched first, followed by the Shared folder. 
This discovery process is identical to the process used to discover partial views.

By default, every layout must call RenderBody. Wherever the call to RenderBody is placed, the contents of the view will be rendered.
